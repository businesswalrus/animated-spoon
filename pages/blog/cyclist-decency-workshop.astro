            <h2 class="section-heading">THE SERIOUS SIDE</h2>

            <p>While we have fun with the satirical tone, our workshop did address some legitimate safety concerns. The reality is that both cyclists and motorists need education on sharing roadways properly until we achieve the ideal: separated infrastructure for each.</p>
            
            <p>Our most effective point was demonstrating how much safer and more enjoyable cycling becomes on dedicated paths. Many cyclists left the workshop advocating for separated bike paths themselves, recognizing that it's in everyone's best interest.</p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-primary mt-4" role="alert">
              <strong>FACT CHECK:</strong> Cyclists on dedicated paths report 87% higher satisfaction with their riding experience compared to those sharing roads with motor vehicles. Proper infrastructure is a win-win.
