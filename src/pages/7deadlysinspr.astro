            <div>
                <span class="grade">A+</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            The undisputed champion of sin, Barnes achieves near-perfection across the board with a commanding presence in Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, and Wrath. This is a person who has fully embraced the darker aspects of human nature with remarkable consistency. The only thing preventing absolute corruption is a surprising streak of industriousness.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Sloth (F) - Ironically, Barnes' fatal flaw is actually working too hard at being sinful. This uncharacteristic work ethic is the only thing keeping them from a perfect score.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#2</span>

            <div>
                <span class="grade">A</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            A formidable competitor who maxes out Pride, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, and Sloth. Raph represents the perfect storm of self-obsession, desire, and laziness. Their approach to sin is comprehensive and unapologetic, showing particular strength in the lustful and gluttonous departments.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Wrath (F) and Greed (D) - Ironically named, as they're surprisingly chill when it comes to actual anger, and apparently content with what they have. These peaceful tendencies are the only things holding Raph back from elite status.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#3</span>
            <span class="name">Buddy</span>
            <div>
                <span class="grade">B+</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            A well-rounded sinner with strong performances across most categories. Buddy demonstrates particular excellence in Sloth and shows solid marks in Pride, Greed, Envy, Gluttony, and Wrath. This is someone who has found a comfortable balance in their moral failings.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Lust (F) - Buddy's complete disinterest in lustful pursuits is their defining characteristic. This singular gap in an otherwise impressive resume suggests a disciplined restraint in at least one area of life.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#4</span>
            <span class="name">Pup</span>
            <div>
                <span class="grade">C+</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Pup is a study in extremes - absolutely dominant in Gluttony and Sloth, but surprisingly restrained in most other areas. This is someone who has chosen their vices carefully, preferring the comfort of laziness and overindulgence to the more active sins.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Lust (F) - Like Buddy, Pup shows zero interest in lustful pursuits. Combined with low marks in Pride, Greed, Envy, and Wrath, Pup is essentially a lazy glutton with a humble attitude.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#5</span>

            <div>
                <span class="grade">C+</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Lucas presents a unique profile with strong showings in Greed and Lust, but surprisingly weak in Envy and Wrath. This suggests someone who takes what they want without getting angry or jealous about it - a remarkably pragmatic approach to sin.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Envy (F) and Wrath (F) - Lucas appears to be emotionally stable, neither envying others nor getting particularly angry. This zen-like acceptance is unusual given the high marks in other categories.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#6</span>

            <div>
                <span class="grade">C</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            True to their name, Gentleman Gaga shows restraint in most areas but absolutely excels in Gluttony. With perfect scores in both Gluttony and Lust, this is someone who knows how to indulge their appetites while maintaining a relatively genteel demeanor in other aspects.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Wrath (F) - Never angry. Combined with low Greed, Envy, and Pride scores, Gentleman Gaga appears to be a mostly pleasant person with a few specific indulgences.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#7</span>

            <div>
                <span class="grade">C-</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            AB is remarkably average across the board, with a slight preference for Sloth. This is someone who dabbles in all the sins without committing fully to any of them - a dilettante of moral failure. The consistency is almost admirable in its mediocrity.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Wrath (F) - Once again, anger is the missing ingredient. AB appears to be a calm, moderately sinful individual who prefers laziness to confrontation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Mike shows strong Greed but otherwise maintains a remarkably balanced (read: mediocre) profile across all sins. There's a businesslike quality to Mike's approach - solid marks everywhere without any particular area of excellence or failure.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> No standout weaknesses, but also no standout strengths. Mike is the definition of average sinfulness, which in this context might be the most damning assessment of all.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Galvin maintains perfect mediocrity with threes across Pride, Greed, Lust, and Wrath. This is someone who understands sin conceptually but hasn't fully committed to the lifestyle. The low Gluttony and Sloth scores suggest a person who at least tries to maintain some discipline.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Gluttony (F) and Sloth (F) - Galvin appears to be relatively hardworking and restrained in consumption. These virtuous tendencies significantly drag down the overall sin score.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#10</span>

                <span class="grade">D+</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Stephen shows exceptional Greed but is surprisingly restrained in most other categories. This is someone who wants more money or possessions but doesn't let that desire manifest in other sinful behaviors. A focused, almost professional approach to moral failing.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Gluttony (F) and Sloth (F) - Like Galvin, Stephen works hard and shows restraint in consumption. Also notably low in Envy and Lust.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="person-card">
        <div class="person-header">
            <span class="rank">#11</span>

                <span class="grade">D</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Ham leads with Pride and Gluttony, suggesting someone with a healthy ego and appetite. However, the low scores across Greed, Envy, Wrath, and Sloth indicate a relatively straightforward person who doesn't complicate their life with too many vices.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Greed (F) and Wrath (F) - Ham neither wants more than they have nor gets angry about things. Combined with low Envy and Lust, Ham seems relatively content with life.
        </div>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Bob is all about the Greed, maxing out that category while showing remarkable restraint everywhere else. This is someone who wants more but doesn't let that desire corrupt other aspects of their character. A surprisingly principled approach to avarice.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Gluttony (F) and Sloth (F) - Bob works hard and shows dietary restraint. Also surprisingly low in Envy and Lust despite the high Greed score.
        </div>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Matt shows a concerning lack of commitment to sin across the board. With mostly low scores and only moderate Pride and Greed, Matt appears to be someone who mostly has their life together. This is barely qualifying for the rankings at all.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Lust (F) and Sloth (F) - Matt works hard and shows no interest in lustful pursuits. Combined with low marks in Envy, Gluttony, and Wrath, Matt is dangerously close to being virtuous.

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Jake brings up the rear with an almost suspiciously virtuous profile. With six categories scoring below average and only moderate Pride and Greed, Jake appears to be the closest thing this group has to a saint. This is frankly disappointing from a sin perspective.
        </div>
        <div class="weakness">
            <strong>Weakness:</strong> Wrath (F) and Sloth (F) - Jake never gets angry and isn't lazy. Combined with minimal Lust, Envy, and Gluttony, Jake needs to seriously reconsider their life choices if they want to compete at this level.
